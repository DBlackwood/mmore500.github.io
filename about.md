I grew up in Corvallis, Oregon then moved to Tacoma, Washington to attend the University of Puget Sound.
I expect to graduate as a Coolidge Otis Chapman Honors Scholar in May 2017 with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science and a minor in Chemistry.
My current interest is in biologically-inspired approaches
to computing.
This semester, I plan to write a thesis on genotypic encodings in evolutionary algorithms.
In the long term, I hope to work in the field of artificial intelligence.

In my spare time on campus, I enjoy playing the oboe with the University of Puget Sound Wind Ensemble and tutoring at the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching.
I wrote for the University of Puget Sound Sound Economics Blog, which you can read [here](https://blogs.pugetsound.edu/econ/), for a few years.
I also like to take pictures--you can look at a few of them [here](http://mmore500.tumblr.com).
I particularly love the green spaces around Corvallis, which appear frequently in my photographs.
