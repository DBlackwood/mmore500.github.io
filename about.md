I grew up in Corvallis, Oregon then moved to Tacoma, Washington to attend the
University of Puget Sound. I expect to graduate as a Coolidge Otis Chapman
Honors Scholar in May 2017 with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science and a
minor in Chemistry. My current interest is in biologically-inspired approaches
to computing. This semester, I plan to write a thesis on genotypic encodings in
evolutionary algorithms. In the long term, I hope to work in the field of
artificial intelligence.

In my spare time on campus, I enjoy playing the oboe with the University of Puget Sound Wind Ensemble and tutoring at the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching. I wrote for the University of Puget Sound Sound Economics Blog, which you can read [here](https://blogs.pugetsound.edu/econ/), for a few years. I also like to take pictures--you can look at a few of them [here](http://mmore500.tumblr.com). I particularly love the green spaces around Corvallis, which appear frequently in my photographs.
