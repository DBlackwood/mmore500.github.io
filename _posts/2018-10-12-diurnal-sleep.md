I like to think that graduate school is about dreaming big things.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult to dream when you do not sleep [[citation needed]](https://xkcd.com/285/).
In fact, without sleep, things you might want to be doing when you're awake can become more difficult, too.
Things like, say, [not crashing your Navy boat](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/634/human-error-in-volatile-situations/act-two-3) or getting good research work done.
(If you are in the mood for more factoids about the importance of sleep and/or are curious about 'Sleep 101' at Harvard, look [here](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/10/12/sleep-class-harvard)).
Moving into graduate school, I struggled (and still do) with sleeping when I wanted to.
I would key this as the most difficult aspect of my transition into graduate school.

As an undergraduate, I had an entirely different --- perhaps entirely opposite --- problem.
Falling asleep was easy...
often easier, in fact, than *not* falling asleep.
My undergraduate sleep habits were an artifact of over-scheduling.
Some of the worst of it, I remember was having the score for the opera *Le comte Ory* unexpectedly thrust onto my music stand.
(I was obliged because I held an oboe scholarship.)
We met for up to *five hour* pit orchestra rehearsals that were scheduled through 11 p.m. (!!!), after which I would leave to *start* my other homework.
I employed a greedy sleep-scheduling policy.
Because it was in short supply, sleeping was always a useful, "productive" activity.
Thus, at the time it made sense to weigh sleep equally against any other to-do and schedule it first as often as possible,
"I can schedule sleep now and do that tomorrow."
Being perpetually sleep deprived, sleeping wherever and whenever I had the time and then rolling out of bed seven minutes before a 7:30 a.m. organic chemistry exam was workable --- I almost never had problems falling asleep.

Graduating and moving on to a lifestyle where I could have some free time (?!??!?!), this sleep scheduling strategy worked very, very poorly.
For me, without restrictions, greedy sleep-scheduling means sleeping 10 or 11 hours a night.
During my first summer in East Lansing, I had very few restrictions.
I rapidly regressed to severe night-owlishness.
(See my disproportionate amount of nocturnal wandering around MSU during [August, 2017](http://mmore500.tumblr.com/archive/2017/8)).
Very soon, I realized that severe night-owlishness was for my bad for my work output and my personal wellbeing.
The solution, I reasoned, was simply to go to bed at a reasonable hyour.
I tried getting into bed at 9 or 10 p.m. and sit there, wide awake, until 3 a.m., 4 a.m. or later.
Of course, then I'd sleep through noon or later.
As this carried onward, I felt I had lost control of very basic and important aspects of my life.

So began a long trial-and-error search for interventions to get myself to sleep during the night and be awake during the day.
I tried a lot of things.
Early on, I focused on the *falling asleep* part of the equation.
It was only a few months in that I realized that *waking up* was also an important target for intervention.

With respect to human sleep, there is no shortage of variables to play with.
I tried a lot of things.
In this blog, I'll blitz through various sleep interventions I've tried, in no particular order.
For anyone working to keep a workable sleep schedule, maybe you'll come away with some new ideas to try out.
Regardless, I hope my shotgun approach here might at least have some entertainment value.

## Alarm Clock <a name="AlarmClock"></a>

Through my long-time struggle with alarm clocks, I've identified three wakefulness states:

1. fully asleep (self explanatory),
2. lizard brain (e.g., only capable of limited decision-making based on immediate trade-offs), and
3. conscious (e.g., mostly or fully capable of rational decision-making).

The fortunate thing about my lizard brain is that it seems surprisingly well informed about what's on the calendar (e.g., an organic chemistry exam in seven minutes that's a five minute walk away).
Even when my alarm doesn't go off (usually because I set p.m. rather than a.m.), I am often surprised by how well my lizard brain can pick up on when I *need* to be up to avoid catastrophe (e.g., 7:23 a.m. for the 7:30 a.m. organic chemistry exam).
The unfortunate thing about lizard brain is that it really doesn't know and/or care about any conscious decisions I've made about when I *want* to be up.
As you'll see a little later, I have had no success in attempts to trick lizard brain into cooperating.
So, to influence my sleep patterns on the morning side of the equation, I need to figure out how to get past lizard brain to reach the conscious state.
Easier said than done.

On the left, my long-time mortal enemy.
This little Timex makes a crude, irritating electronic beep.
It gets the job done, but it can make me feel like I'm waking up with a hangover (especially if lizard brain doesn't want to be up yet).
Unfortunately, my lizard brain has become quite good at ignoring the Timex or hitting the snooze button.
In high school, my mom, who from time to time had to leave at 6 a.m. for work, sometimes had to call the neighbor over to ring our doorbell to wake me up.
Our neighbor could hear this alarm clock going off from the front door.
To try to force myself to bypass lizard brain and reach consciousness, I tried relocating the alarm clock into my living room.
Lizard brain immediately became adept at rolling out of bed, staggering down the hall into the living room, hitting the snooze button (even when I tried placing the Timex under a colander with a bowl of cereal on top), and retreating back to bed.
On some weekend mornings, I figure that I have hit the snooze button *upwards of 12 times* (quarter hour increments over three hours).
The traditional alarm clock clearly doesn't succeed at putting me past lizard brain to full consciousness.
The Timex *is* useful to make sure that I don't miss important morning meetings/etc. because under these circumstances I have lizard brain's full cooperation.
(Because it uses a backup 9 Volt battery, it is especially useful for *important* occasions.).

Recently, I've found more success easing past lizard brain into full consciousness using a clock-radio tuned to NPR.
It's actually an Amazon Alexa, which only [recently gained this capability](https://www.gearbrain.com/amazon-alexa-music-alarm-clock-2516832019.html).
I have it set to low volume, usually at 5:30 a.m.
The thing is, though, I don't expect to get up at 5:30 a.m.
I actualy expect wake up sometime between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.
Lizard brain doesn't seem to care about quiet, soothing NPR voices ([despite what they're often actually talking about](https://democracyjournal.org/alcove/should-we-want-politics-to-be-boring/)).
I think I pass through lizard brain stage, which is not moved to turn off the stimulus, and, with continued application of the stimulus, eventually gain enough consciousness to decide to get out of bed.
I've experienced one side effect: occasional extremely vivid dreams about whatever topic is being covered on NPR.
I can live with that.
My DIY sunrise lamp ([details below](#SunriseLamp)) also seems to help me ease past lizard brain.

A few years ago, I tried using a music playlist as an alarm.
Unfortunately, the playlist couldn't be shuffled, so the first track to come on was always the same.
Lizard brain very quickly learned to recognize it and *hate it*, leaving me right back in snooze button hell.
After a month or so, I didn't even like to hear the track any more when I was awake.
Besides being too uniform of a stimulus, the music alarm might have been too loud and/or music might just be inherently too strong of a stimulus for lizard brain to tolerate.
If you do go for a music-based alarm, you might play with the alarm volume and try making sure that your alarm always plays a different sequence of tracks (e.g., shuffle over a large selection or tuning into a music-oriented radio station).

My smart health-tracker has a wristwatch.
It took about two days for lizard brain to clue in and treat it just like the Timex.
This worked well for a while, and I have vague notions of being less annoyed by it, but my lizard brain has

I find that cooler temperatures (e.g., maybe 62 F) can help me fall asleep.

Leaving the window open.

## Noise

An unfortunate trade-off accompanies leaving the window open: noise.

Even if I can't sleep otherwise, noise just makes me angry.
Feeling angry doesn't help me sleep.
Noise makes me so angry, in fact, that I have woken up in the middle of lizard brain yelling at noisemakers at a volume I didn't know possible.

Unfortunately, probably your best bet to manage noise problems is choosing where to live which (a) you probably don't get to do very often and (b) you might not have full control over.


Beware: outdoor hallways, courtyards, public balconies, and fire escapes.
That is, unless you're into listening to gratuitously protracted conversations about asinine algorithms to rank women *(drunk)* or how, man, isn't it just wild that the capitalists beat the communists to the moon even though, you know, they were just like all about making melon ballers and whatever useless other shit *(high)*?
Despite, I'm still obsessed with my building's balconies

Also potentialy problematic: parking lots... i.e., woofer at all hours.  coming and going, but this is usually transient and therefore, to me, much less aggravating.

This sound-proof-ness of walls is so, so important, and varies widely.
You can check on this when you're touring an apartment (and you should!).
I got lucky: often, I only become aware of well-underway [Miley-level Bangerz (tm)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco) next door during the brief moments the front door opens to admit and/or expel party people.
On the flip side, my boyfriend lived in [a dorm](https://www.pugetsound.edu/student-life/campus-living/residence-life/residence-halls-houses/trimble-hall/) with walls so thin you (unavoidably) learned to recognize who was in the bathroom two doors down by the sound of their urination.

One of my very, very all-time favorite pieces of journalism comes from James Day of my hometown Corvallis Gazette Times.
In reports from
[2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20181012235912/https://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/neighborhood-stakeout/article_0975b653-b0cf-58e8-9b2d-ac3d3761b069.html),

he stakes out student-heavy neighborhoods --- sometimes accompanied by grumpy long-time residents --- in order to record a meticulous litany of livability complaints.
I find the articles endlessly entertaining.
If you are insane enough, you might take a cue from James Day's intrepid reporting and stake out your intended neighborhood (especially on a Friday or Saturday night) to check noise levels.

Probably a better idea is to simply clue in to who else lives in the building/neighborhood your considering.
Do "real people" live there?
What about other grad students?
Then it's probably a safe bet noise-wise.
You might also consult with current residents of the town you're moving into.
They will probably have plenty of opinions to share about the livability of various neighborhoods, and will steer you out of at least the inner circles of undergraduate hell.

*"A Judgemental Map of East Lansing"*
[[source]](https://theblacksheeponline.com/michigan-state/the-black-sheeps-judgmental-map-of-east-lansing)

Besides choosing somewhere quiet to live, you can also, you know, just ask your neighbors to keep the noise under control.
As a freshman, my dorm room shared a wall with a wanna-be DJ.
We worked out a system where I would bang on the wall and he'd turn down the volume 25%.
Compromise!

Sometimes, at 2am, though, I really don't feel like going outside.
Yelling out the window is always an option.
Last summer, to my great disorientation, I woke up in the middle of lizard brain yelling at noisemakers to quiet down.
I didn't know I had that voice inside me.
From that point onwards, whoever was babysitting made a sincere effort to shush the noisemakers and bring them back inside after they were done throwing up.
I really did appreciate the courtesy.

A few times, I've considered calling in a noise violation but never quite felt adequately disturbed.
A few important pointers for that:

1. Don't call 911... call the non-emergency line instead (the number should be on your local police department's website).
2. Really, you should ask (or yell) first... [frivolous/biased calls to authorities are a real problem](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/10/yes-311-nuisance-calls-are-climbing-gentrifying-neighborhoods/573271/).

Also, sometimes I forget this, but just rolling over and putting a pillow over your head can help a lot, too.

For some people, some noises can be pleasant!

Your smart speaker can probably play white noise.
I played with this some, but didn't care for it.

[My army of fans](#Temperature) generates plenty of white noise.
Some nights, I'm super into the fan noise.
Other nights, I'm not.
On those nights, it's nice being able to [turn everything off with a voice command](#SmartHome).

I like listening to a brief newscast before sleep.
I currently have "NPR News Now" and "BBC World Service" set up on my Alexa's [Flash Briefing](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/flashbriefing/understand-the-flash-briefing-skill-api.html)

I used to listen to Garrison Keillor's [The Writer's Almanac](https://www.writersalmanac.org/) regularly, but I have [mixed feelings](https://web.archive.org/web/20181021144359/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/02/kevin-spacey-deserves-scorned-watch-house-of-cards) after [his unacceptable conduct](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/01/23/keillor-workplace) came to light.
The Almanac briefly ceased to exist but has since [returned to production](https://art19.com/shows/the-writers-almanac).
Attempts ([1](https://bidwellhollow.com/replacing-the-writers-almanac/), [2](http://theartistsalmanac.org/)) to fill [the void](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2017/12/06/poets-writers-almanac), unfortunately, don't seem to have stuck.

If there's a podcast feed you like that's not currently available as a Flash Briefing skill, it's actually very straightforward (takes maybe fifteen minutes, no coding involved) to fix that.
There are two pieces you need to put together.
First, you need to create a mirror RSS feed that only serves up the most recent episode of your podcast.
Otherwise, Alexa will play through *all* the available episodes every time, which probably isn't what you want.
It's easy (and free) to do this with a RSS to RSS "zap" from [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) where you set your mirror RSS feed to only return one item (e.g., `Max Records` = 1).
Then, hop on over to Amazon to register a developer account, [click a few buttons](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/flashbriefing/steps-to-create-a-flash-briefing-skill.html), and paste in your Zaipier RSS url.
Once you save the skill, it should become available to "test" on your Alexa devices.
You can comfortably continue using the skill like this without ever needing to officially publish it.

When I first moved into my neighborhood in East Lansing, I was thrown for a loop by a very out of place bit of apparent pro-MSU graffiti: green spray paint on a street light.
It wasn't until I walked by after dark that I realized that, duh, the homeowner whose window the [bad streetlight](http://darksky.org/our-work/lighting/bad-streetlights/) violated had taken prerogative for unilateral action.
Inspired, I aluminum foiled an exterior light at my building that shines directly in my bedroom.
It's been up for almost a year now with no problems.

Another option: plant a big shrubbery between your window and the offending light source.
My mom did this when Oregon State put in a new [barn-classroom thing](https://events.oregonstate.edu/james_e_oldfield_animal_teaching_facility) right behind her house.

After consulting an attorney, do whatever you want.
Just be sure that your righteous self-empowerment won't catch fire.

## Light

### Sunrise Lamp <a name="SunriseLamp"></a>

![](https://osf.io/v5f4d/download){:width="100%"}

I combined an [Ikea FADO table lamp](https://www.google.com/search?q=ikea%20fado&tbm=isch) with a smart lightbulb to make a DIY sunrise lamp.
The idea here is the light is on a timer to gently fade in before I want to get up to gradually shift my body towards wakefulness.
I quite like it, especially in combination with [a clock radio alarm](#AlarmClock).
It's probably ranks among the more effective interventions I've tried.
Plus, it doubles as a handy voice-controlled light via Amazon Alexa.

A few details:
* I originally scheduled the bulb to fade in across linearly spaced brightness increments (e.g., 10% to 20% to 30% to 40% etc.).
After a few days, I switched to exponentially spaced brightness increments, which I like much more (e.g., 1% to 2% to 4% to 8% etc.).
* I schedule the bulb to automatically turn off after two hours at full brightness (e.g., every day at 7 a.m.) so it doesn't stay on all day if I don't happen to be home to turn it off my self.
* Currently, Ikea doesn't stock appear to stock the FADO table lamp in the US.
I bought my lamp on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) for about $50.
The smart bulb cost about $15.
Be careful if you try to pick up a lamp designed for a different region (e.g., Europe) because the power plug might be incompatible with your outlet.
* The free [If This Than That](https://ifttt.com) service (IFTTT), which serves as a kind of handy duct tape to control smart devices among other things, only offers time triggers at fifteen minute granularity.
Luckily, the [particular no-brand smart bulb](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DFGPG57/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I bought provides proprietary timing functionality that allowed for brightness changes at one minute increments.
I ended up using a combination of IFTTT and proprietary triggers because the proprietary only offered six daily schedulable events.
* If you end up with a smart bulb that doesn't offer proprietary timing triggers (or, even better, trigger-able configurable fades), you might be able to achieve a reasonable fade in through [clever acrobatics via another service called Stringify](#SmartHome).

### Happy Lamp

There are a lot of [things I like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeron_chair) about [our lab](http://devosoft.org/)'s [office space](https://www3.beacon-center.org/).

My go-to is melatonin.
I'm not totally convinced it's objectively very effective, but it tends to feel helpful.
I'll take a good [placebo effect](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-placebo-effect-amazing-and-real-201511028544) any day.
If I'm already nice and drowsy at bedtime, I'll just skip it.

When melatonin doesn't cut it and I'm still awake after half an hour or an hour, about once or twice a week nowadays, I'll fall back on *Doxylamine Succinate* aka *Unisom* or --- if I'm feeling congested, too --- drowsy allergy medication (*Cetirizine Hydrochloride* aka *Zyrtec*).

This only works if your conscious brain is at play.
Lizard brain didn't clue into this, so it didn't work.
It might work better with someone else in the loop to help hold you accountable.
There are plenty of apps out there [set up just for this type of thing](https://betterhumans.coach.me/6-accountability-apps-that-will-skyrocket-your-success-6a3c1821e15b).

## Schedule Activities in the Morning

Lizard brain seems to be *very* well clued into the potential shame of tardiness or truancy for obligations like class, medical appointments, and volunteer activities.
Last year, I intentionally scheduled myself to volunteer at 8am two days a week to help regulate my sleep schedule.
However, this trick only really works for morning activities I'm *truly obligated* to follow through with, because lizard brain seems to know the difference.

## Naps

When you are constantly sleep deprived, naps can be a useful tool.
When you sleep 10 hours a night, napping just because you don't feel like doing whatever you're supposed to be doing right now is not so helpful and will leave you awake at ungodly hours of the day.

## Working Late

If you are a busy beaver surfing an endless wave of imminent deadlines, working late makes sense.
When I started to realize .
Now, unless I truly cannot avoid it, I try to avoid working after 10 p.m.
Often, working late can be avoided [through some proactive effort](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html).
Even in a pinch though, I'll sometimes decide to just go to bed anyways.
Taking seriously the impact that staying up to do it will have on your sleep for days to come (or weeks, if it really throws you off kilter)TODO

Also, be aware of (sometimes subtle) institutional forces that [encourage](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/09/08/many-college-students-don-sleep-well-this-harvard-course-hopes-change-that/xMiKiboMFH8UFMR9lgennL/story.html) or [mandate](https://medium.com/@mattyoung_97598/sleep-deprivation-with-regards-to-hackathons-722d9d43c2ad) working late.

Bringing in professionals never hurts.

### Blackout Curtains

Yup, this is [a thing you can do](https://xkcd.com/1973/).

### Get a Prescription

### Meditation

Counting sheep is straight-up bullshit.

Other meditation practices (that weren't obviously designed to keep restless kids occupied) might be of more benefit.
