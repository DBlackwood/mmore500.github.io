I made a nifty usb-powered LED flat light to review film.
I'll show you how!

Back lighting is useful for viewing sleeved negatives.
Something like a trace table would be the absolute ideal solution for this, but for occasional use a smaller LED panel does the trick.

I based this project off of a how-to from instructables by *the_kage* you can find [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Build-a-USB-Powered-LED-Light/).

## Supplies

For this project, you'll need:

* a usb-to-anything cable you don't mind destroying
* a 68 ohm resistor
  * I found mine [on Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/psp500kr-68r/yageo), which doesn't seem to have a minimum shipping requirement
* a LED usb panel
  * listed on [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1621)
  * Arrow Electronics also carries this item
* scissors
* soldering stuff
  * soldering iron
  * solder
  * flux
* heat-shrink wire sleeves
* wire strippers or a paring knife
* nail polish

## Assembly

1. clip cable near the non-usb end of the cable and strip wire back half an inch
  * black and red wires are power, other colors are data
2. clip back one wire to make room for the resistor
3. solder together
* put on heat-shrink wire sleeves
4. cover exposed soldering with nail polish
  * be careful about it dripping/collecting on the bottom of the wire
5. plug it in and test!

## Use

I keep my film in PrintFile sleeves in a three-ring binder.
(The leftmost image above is from [printfile.com](https://printfile.com).)
The flat LED is easy to slip between pages to back light the film.
The panel is the right size to illuminate approximately two 35mm images at a time.

Looking at negatives gives some sense of focus/detail (especially with a magnifying loupe) and subject, but I can't get an aesthetic sense of the image without seeing the positive.
(I suspect interpreting negatives takes considerable practice.)
I've found that using my phone's camera with [the "invert colors" accessibility feature](https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/ios-invert-colors-shortcut/) of my phone gives a convenient, easier-to-digest preview.
